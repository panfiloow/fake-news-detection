# fake-news-detection
This project focuses on developing a model for detecting fake news using machine learning techniques. We apply TfidfVectorizer to transform text data and PassiveAggressiveClassifier to classify news as real or fake.

Project Goals:

- To develop a model that can effectively distinguish between real and fake news.

- Investigating methods of textual information processing and model training.

- Visualization of the model results

Technologies used:

- Python: the main programming language for project realization.

- Pandas: for data processing and analysis.

- Scikit-learn: a library for machine learning used for text vectorization and model building.

- Matplotlib and Seaborn: libraries for data and results visualization.

Project structure:

- fake_news.rar: a data file containing the text of news items and their labels (REAL or FAKE).

- fake_news_detection_model.ipynb: Google Colab containing code to process the data, train the model and evaluate its performance.

- README.md: project description, startup and usage instructions.
